A GDPR Multisite plugin, that adds special privileges to a subsite Administrator for Privacy settings.

== Description ==

This plugin is only for Multisite networks! It will give special privileges to every subsite administrator, that has the same email address, what is set as the main email address for that particular subsite. So every subsite can set their own privacy settings and they will have the option to export or remove personal data if required by the user. This is a very important feature if you want to compile with GDPR.

Only one user will get the special capabilities to set and edit the privacy policy page and get access to user data export or removal pages. The user must be an administrator and the user's email address must match with the default email address under Settings page.

### The Problem

By default, the new Privacy settings introduced in WordPress 4.9.6 is available only for single install Administrators or if you use a Multsiite install, it is available only for Super Admins. There is no default option to enable Privacy settings for subsites. It can be a big problem for you subsite users, because they can not meet the GDPR rules.

This plugin will give subsite Administrators access to these new privacy features. Only one administrator will get these new privileges, who has the same email, that is set under Settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I give these privileges to other user? =

You need to add administrator role to a user to be able to get these privacy privileges. When you change the default email address under the Settings page, the user will get the new privileges to set and edit the Privacy Policy page and get access to export or remove personal data for users.

= Does it have any security risk for the Multisite network? =

No, it will not have any security risk for the Multisite network. Personal user data export or deletion will affect only the subsite's data.

= What does Surbma mean? =

It is the reverse version of my last name. ;)
